## Worked with/sources 
* "Connor", "Jared", "Caleb", "Jay", "Jed" gave me their names for the practice list
* I looked at my notes from class for sorting
* https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_change.asp (syntax for insert)
* 
## Project Quirks/ Things that don't work
* I had a hard time figuring out the syntax for .upper. I first tried to put the index in the parentheses after upper, but I kept moving things until I figured it out.
